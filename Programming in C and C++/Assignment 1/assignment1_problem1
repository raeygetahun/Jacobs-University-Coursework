}

/*The reason why the result were 0.0000 is because the 
operands were int and this made the result to be int.
Thus evenif the correct result was 0.8, only the zero 
is displayed. The other zeros that comes after the decimal
point is because of the % 1f which is a double float.
Making atleast one operand a double will ensure that the 
result of the operation will not be truncated into an integer.*/
